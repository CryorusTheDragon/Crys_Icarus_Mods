# Flick Those Devices
[**Flick Those Devices**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/edit/Flick-Those-Devices)

Simple and straightforward : 
Allows many devices like generators , furnaces to be flicked on or off by pressing the interact button while looking at it. 
Accessing the UI is now a "hold interact" action for those. 

## Add-On :
An Add-On mod for my [Reasonable Water mod](https://shorturl.at/hntX7) that enables the flick function on them as well.

## Warning
 Warning :<br>
This mod makes changes to the follwing .json files :<br> D_ItemsStatic, D_Interactable, D_Interactions <br>
It is recommended to use the [Icarus Mod Manager by Jimk72](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software/raw/main/IcarusModManager_1_6_7_Full.zip) to safely merge mods for the game.
