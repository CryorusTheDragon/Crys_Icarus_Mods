[**Reasonable Water**]( https://shorturl.at/hntX7 )

Too many T2 and T3 Stations have a possible Water intake but you cant access Water Networks until T4.

To add insult to injury you HAVE to be near a water source, which can cause long water networks impacting performance. 
This mod introduces 3 new deployables to aid in your water needs. 
A solid fuel, bio fuel and electric water drill allowing you to create water sources on land and caves.
For balance reasons those are more expensive than the water pump and bring 150 / 400 / 800 Units of water to the network.
As of now they use the generator mesh and model (which also works as a pseudo balance IMO)
