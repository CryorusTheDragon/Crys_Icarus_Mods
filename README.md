# Cryorus' Icarus Mods

## Shout-out
First of all shout out to all the modders in the Linkarus Modding Discord for helping me understand the games inner workings ! 

## List of Mods : 

1. [**Reasonable Water**]( https://shorturl.at/hntX7 ) <br>
Adds some new machines across T3 & T4 and moves the water pipe tool to the machining bench to make water more accessible in the middle game.<br>

2. CARBON Paste <br>
To be added soon to git

3. Improved T3&4 Tools <br>
A mod to adjust the platinum and titanium tier of tools to give actual reason to upgrade/sidegrade <br>
NOTE: Very WIP and subject to lots of changes - ATM only adjustments to the tool stats like yield and dmg.

4. Functional Mill <br>
WIP mod to add a tier between mortar & pestle and material processor ( why isnt there a grindstone already in the game ??)
## Warning
It is recommended to use the [Icarus Mod Manager by Jimk72](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software/raw/main/IcarusModManager_1_6_7_Full.zip) to safely merge mods for the game.
