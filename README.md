# Reasonable Water
1. [**Reasonable Water**]( https://shorturl.at/hntX7 )

- Too many T2 and T3 Stations have a possible Water intake but you cant access Water Networks until T4.<br>
 To add insult to injury you HAVE to be near a water source, which can cause long water networks impacting performance.<br>
 This mod introduces 3 new deployables to aid in your water needs.<br>
 A solid fuel, bio fuel and electric water drill allowing you to create water sources on land and caves.<br>
 For balance reasons those are more expensive than the water pump and bring 150 / 400 / 800 Units of water to the network.<br>
 As of now they use the generator mesh and model (which also works as a pseudo balance IMO)<br>

## Warning
