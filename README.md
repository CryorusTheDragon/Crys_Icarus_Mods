# Reasonable Water
[**Reasonable Water**]( https://shorturl.at/hntX7 )

Too many T2 and T3 Stations have a possible Water intake but you cant access Water Networks until T4.<br>
To add insult to injury you HAVE to be near a water source, which can cause long water networks impacting performance.<br>
This mod introduces 3 new deployables to aid in your water drilling and pumping needs:<br>
- Burner Drill
  - Water Generated : 150 Units
  - Fuel : Coal and Meteor Coal (A stack of 100 lasts 60m)
- Bio Fuel Drill
  - Water Generated : 400 Units
  - Fuel : Bio Fuel (A full jerrycan last 120m )
- Electrical Drill
  - Water Generated : 750 Units
  - Fuel : Electrical , needs 800 units of power
 
All three drills need to be placed on ground and can be used in caves <br>
As of now they use the generator mesh and model (which also works as a pseudo balance IMO)<br>
