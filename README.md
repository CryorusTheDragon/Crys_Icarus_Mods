# Cryorus' Icarus Mods

## Shout-out
First of all shout out to all the modders in the Linkarus Modding Discord for helping me understand the games inner workings ! 

## List of Mods : 

### [**Reasonable Water**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/tree/ReasonableWater)
Adds some new machines across T3 & T4 and moves the water pipe tool to the machining bench to make water more accessible in the middle game.<br>

---

### [**CARBON Paste**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/tree/CARBONPaste)
Putting the CARBON back into carbon pase !<br>

### [**Cry's Advanced Leveling // Lvl 120 Cap**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/edit/Cry's-Advanced-Leveling)
A Suite of mods to raise the lvl cap and give more skill points<br>
Use only ONE at a time! <br>

### [**Flick Those Devices**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/edit/Flick-Those-Devices)
Simple and straightforward : 
Allows many devices like generators , furnaces to be flicked on or off by pressing the interact button while looking at it. 
Accessing the UI is now a "hold interact" action for those. 

---

### [**Improved T3&4 Tools**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/tree/Improved_T3+4_Tools)
A mod to adjust the platinum and titanium tier of tools to give actual reason to upgrade/sidegrade <br>
NOTE: Very WIP and subject to lots of changes - ATM only adjustments to the tool stats like yield and dmg.

---
### Functional Mill 
Not yet started but planned
WIP mod to add a tier between mortar & pestle and material processor ( why isnt there a grindstone already in the game ??)

---


## Warning
It is recommended to use the [Icarus Mod Manager by Jimk72](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software/raw/main/IcarusModManager_1_6_7_Full.zip) to safely merge mods for the game.
