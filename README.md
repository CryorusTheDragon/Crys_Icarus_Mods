# Cry's Advanced Leveling // Lvl 120 Cap 
[**Cry's Advanced Leveling // Lvl 120 Cap**](https://github.com/CryorusTheDragon/Icarus_Mods/edit/Cry's-Advanced-Leveling)

This suite of mods raise the visible level cap to lvl 120 and change the amount of Solo and General Talent Points granted. 
Solo Tree is maxed out at lvl 100 for all variants. 

The game as of week 95 has 538 Talent Points in total in the player trees so this mod comes in 4 different flavours : 
25% , 50% , 75% and 100% of the total skill points needed

I tried to keep the curve relative the same as if the normal 90 from the game would be gotten by lvl 60

## 25% Skill Points
| Level | SkillPoints |
|-----:|-----------|
|     30| 50|
|     60| 100|
|     90| 119|
|    120| 135|

## 50% Skill Points:
| Level | SkillPoints |
|-----:|-----------|
|     30| 100|
|     60| 200|
|     90| 238|
|    120| 269|

## 75% Skill Points:
| Level | SkillPoints |
|-----:|-----------|
|     30| 150|
|     60| 300|
|     90| 356|
|    120| 404|

## 100% Skill Points:
| Level | SkillPoints |
|-----:|-----------|
|     30| 200|
|     60| 400|
|     90| 475|
|    120| 538|
